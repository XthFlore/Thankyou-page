  <h1>A Heartfelt Thank You</h1>


  <div class="paragraph">
    From the very first day of class, as a transferee, you made me feel welcomed and encouraged. You didn’t make me feel like I was different — you made me feel like I belong. 
    I don’t remember telling you that Math was my favorite subject... but you probably knew it as we had shared a lot already. Back then, I lost interest in Math back in JHS, but you made me fall in love with it again. 
    You’re just different — your humor, your way of teaching, and your energy.
